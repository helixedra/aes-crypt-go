AES File Cryptor - Quick Start Guide
===================================

1. INSTALLATION
--------------
- Install Go 1.16 or higher
- Build the tools:
  go build keygen.go
  go build cryptor.go

2. GENERATE A KEY
----------------
Run: ./keygen

Choose:
1) Save as .key file (recommended)
   - Enter filename or press Enter for default (secret.key)
   - Keep this file safe!

2) Show Base64 key
   - Copy and save the key securely
   - Use for manual key entry

3. ENCRYPT A FILE
----------------
Run: ./cryptor

1) Choose 1 (Encrypt)
2) Enter file path to encrypt
3) Choose key source:
   1) .key file - enter key file path
   2) Base64 - paste your key
4) Encrypted file saved as [filename].enc

4. DECRYPT A FILE
----------------
Run: ./cryptor

1) Choose 2 (Decrypt)
2) Enter path to .enc file
3) Provide the key (file or Base64)
4) Decrypted file saved with original name

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Keep your keys safe! Losing them means losing access to your files
- The program will overwrite existing files without warning
- For security, use different keys for different files
- Encrypted files have .enc extension

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- Invalid key? Make sure it's 32 bytes (44 Base64 chars)
- File not found? Check the path and permissions
- Decryption failed? Verify the key and file integrity
