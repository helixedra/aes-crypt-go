1. Introduction
---------------
Key Generator and File Cryptor are utilities for secure file encryption and decryption using the AES-256 algorithm.

2. Key Generation
----------------
Run the program:

./keygen

2.1 Saving to a File
-------------------
1. Select option "1) .key file"
2. Enter a filename (default: secret.key)
3. The key will be saved to the specified file

2.2 Displaying as Base64
----------------------
1. Select option "2) Base64"
2. The key will be displayed in the console in Base64 format
3. Copy and save this key in a secure location

3. File Encryption
-----------------
1. Run "cryptor"
2. Select "1) Encrypt"
3. Enter the path to the file you want to encrypt
4. Choose the key source:
   - "1) .key file" - specify the path to the key file
   - "2) Base64 key" - paste the key in Base64 format
5. The encrypted file will be saved with a ".enc" extension

4. File Decryption
-----------------
1. Run "cryptor"
2. Select "2) Decrypt"
3. Enter the path to the encrypted file (with ".enc" extension)
4. Provide the key (from file or enter as Base64)
5. The decrypted file will be saved with the original filename (without ".enc")

5. Security
-----------
* Always store your keys in a secure location
* Never transmit keys over unsecured channels
* It's recommended to use ".key" files instead of Base64, as they don't remain in command line history
* Keep backup copies of your encryption keys
* Losing the key means losing access to your encrypted data

6. Troubleshooting
-----------------

6.1 "Invalid key length" Error
Make sure that:
- The key file contains exactly 32 bytes
- The Base64 key is properly encoded and decodes to 32 bytes

6.2 File Read Error
Check:
- If the specified file exists
- If you have read/write permissions
- If the file path is correct

6.3 Decryption Error
- Ensure you're using the same key that was used for encryption
- Check if the encrypted file is not corrupted

6.4 General Tips
- The program will overwrite files without warning
- One key can be used for multiple files, but using different keys for different files is more secure
- The ".enc" extension is added automatically during encryption
